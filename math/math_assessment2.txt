** Probability **

1. A coin is biased at 0.6 in favor of heads. What is the probability of
flipping 8 or more heads in 10 flips of this coin?

2. You've found a secret admirer note on your desk, and don't know who it
might've come from but you know it must've been one of your three office mates:
Jack, John, or Jimmy.

- As of yesterday, you thought it was twice as likely that Jimmy had a crush on
  you than John, and that John and Jack were equally likely to have a crush on
  you.
- However even if Jimmy liked you, you think there'd only be 5% he'd leave you
  a note.
- On the other hand, if Jack liked you there'd be a whopping 50% chance he'd
  leave you a note.

and if John liked you, there'd be a 20% chance he'd leave you a note.

What's the probability that the note came from John?


** Statistics **

Below are the total number of log-ins to a website for 20 different randomly
selected users from 2017:

[10, 25, 12, 35, 14, 18, 16, 15, 22, 10, 9, 11, 49, 20, 15, 9, 18, 19, 20, 20]

In the following questions, you can assume that this data represents a sample
from the population of all users that used your website in 2017.

3. What is the sample mean?

4. What is the sample variance?

5. If we randomly select another user from 2017, what is an estimate of the
probability that he/she has more than 15 log-ins?

6. The sales department asserts that on average, there were at most 10 log-ins
per user (across the entire population), however the web team thinks there were
more.  Discuss how to set up a null hypothesis significance test, then compute
a p-value based on the sample above to test the web team's hypothesis.  What
conclusion do you draw?
