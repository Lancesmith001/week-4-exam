# Week 4 Exam

### Overview

There are 3 mathematics tests and 3 coding tests. You can work on the problems in any order you like. When coding, you can import any python package that will help you solve the problem. The math problems are in the `math` folder and the coding questions are in the `src` folder.

### Instructions

- Fork and Clone repo
- Run `pytest -v` see the status of your passing/failing tests

### Hints

- I would comment out all failing tests except for the one you are currently working on. It minimizes distration.
- Import any package you need
- Use `print` statements to help debug code
- Read the `test_assessment*` files to help you understand what a test is actually doing
